    <h1>Hello, I am Mark Snodgrass!</h1>
    <h2>Here's a little bit about me:</h2>
    <!--Some History of where I was born and raised-->
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Fishers, IN. I have moved once but it was across town because we wanted a bigger living space.

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td><b>Video Game Collecting</b></td>
            <td>I collect Video Games from across history. Whille the hobby can cost you a lot money, it's a cool way to play some the greats and learn all about the history of gaming.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td><b>Computer Hardware</b></td>
            <td>I love to learn how computer hardware works. Learning how each core and chipset works is really cool to learn about and most of the info you need is out there so you don't need to buy it to learn about it.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td><b>Coding</b></td>
            <td>Coding or Programing is very interesting to me. It's basically a script for the computer to read of off so it knows what to do and having some of that control really feels fun.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td><b>Video Game Modding</b></td>
        <td>Video Game Modding is where you take a game and mess with it's code or files to add or remove content in the game. I love doing this because it allows you to make the game you want and some developers have software or SDK's to make the game easier to mod. For example BoneLab, a physics VR game, has the Marrow SDK which help modders make the mod work and to not have to make your own physics for your mod.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td><b>Playing Trombone</b></td>
            <td>I play Trombone for band class but I like playing it outside of class. I mostly like playing video game music on it but I also love some jazz.</td>
